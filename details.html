Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of water bodies. Water pollution is caused when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater and aquifers get contaminated with industrial and agricultural effluents.

When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.


<h3>Sources Of Water Pollution</h3>
The key causative of water pollution in India are:
<ol>
  <li>Urbanization.</li>
  <li>Deforestation.</li>
  <li>Industrial effluents.</li>
  <li>Social and Religious Practices.</li>
  <li>Use of Detergents and Fertilizers.</li>
  <li>Agricultural run-offs- Use of insecticides and pesticides.</li>
</ol> 
<h3>Effects Of Water Pollution</h3>
The effect of water pollution depends upon the type of pollutants and their concentration. Also, the location of water bodies is an important factor to determine the levels of pollution.
<ul>
<li>Water bodies in the vicinity of urban areas are extremely polluted. This is the result of dumping garbage and toxic chemicals by industrial and commercial establishments.</li>
<li>Water pollution drastically affects aquatic life. It affects their metabolism, and behaviour, and causes illness and eventual death. Dioxin is a chemical that causes a lot of problems from reproduction to uncontrolled cell growth or cancer. This chemical is bioaccumulated in fish, chicken and meat. Chemicals such as this travel up the food chain before entering the human body.</li>
<li>The effect of water pollution can have a huge impact on the food chain. It disrupts the food chain. Cadmium and lead are some toxic substances, these pollutants upon entering the food chain through animals (fish when consumed by animals, humans) can continue to disrupt at higher levels.</li>
<li>Humans are affected by pollution and can contract diseases such as hepatitis through faecal matter in water sources. Poor drinking water treatment and unfit water can always cause an outbreak of infectious diseases such as cholera, etc.
The ecosystem can be critically affected, modified and destructured because of water pollution.</li>
